# Writes the user-facing prose for a GeneratedInsight. The LLM acts as a
# writer, not a reasoner: it receives pre-computed facts and may only phrase
# them. When no LLM provider is configured (common on self-hosted installs),
# nobody in the family has opted into AI, or the call fails, the i18n template
# interpolated with the same facts is used instead, so insight generation
# never depends on an external service.

    You write short insights for a personal finance app.
    Rules:
    - Write 1-2 plain sentences addressed to the user as "you".
    - Use only the facts provided. Never invent numbers, dates, or projections.
    - Repeat monetary amounts exactly as formatted in the facts.
    - No financial advice, no jargon, no emoji, no exclamation marks, no lists or headers.
    - Respond with the sentences only.
